##  Overview

This paper investigates the **"size effect"** in urban street network analysisâ€”specifically how the size of the catchment area affects the calculation of commonly used network indicators such as **average node degree**. It highlights the methodological bias introduced by arbitrarily defined catchment areas and proposes a theoretical framework to determine an appropriate area size for consistent and comparable network evaluations.

##  Key Contributions

- **Problem Identified**: Arbitrary boundaries in spatial network studies distort network metrics.
- **Solution Proposed**: A mathematical model using idealized grid networks to study the sensitivity of indicators like average node degree to catchment size.
- **Findings**:
  - The size effect is prominent until the catchment area reaches approximately **40â€“50 times** the average street length.
  - A **minimum size of 2000Ã—2000mÂ²** is suggested to ensure comparability in pedestrian networks.
- **Applications**: Network analysis, urban morphology comparison, mobility studies, spatial accessibility evaluations.

##  Methodology

- Constructed a theoretical grid network to isolate the size effect.
- Iteratively expanded catchment areas and calculated average node degree.
- Compared results across varying sizes to determine when indicator values stabilize.
- Validated the model with real-world average street lengths.

##  Why This Matters

This work is relevant to urban planners, geographers, and data scientists working with:
- **OpenStreetMap / OSMnx**-based modeling
- **Spatial accessibility analysis**
- **Mobility networks**
- **Urban form classification**

It offers not only theoretical clarity but also **practical recommendations** for designing comparable and scalable urban street network studies.
